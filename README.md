Hey there! I'm Ricky. 👨‍💻  
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on backend development.  
My journey started in 2013, building mods and resources for games I loved playing. 🎮  
Since then, I've been diving deep into coding, creating cool tools, and learning something new daily. 🌱  

While you'll find a few of my projects here on GitHub, most of my work remains private. 🔒  
That said, the public projects here offer a glimpse into the work I enjoy creating — though not the full picture!  

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:  
🚗 Going for spontaneous drives to explore new places  
🏋️‍♂️ Hitting the gym to stay active and push limits  
🎮 Experimenting with mods for games and (sometimes) creating resources  
🛠️ Working on side projects that I'll end up not finishing  
🤝 Hanging out with friends, sharing laughs, and making memories  
🎨 Learning new skills — whether it's design, development, or something completely random  

If you're here to explore my work, feel free to check out some of my repositories or check out some of my GitHub stats below (if you care):
