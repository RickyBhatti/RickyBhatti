Hey there! I'm Ricky. 👨‍💻  
I'm a passionate software developer with a strong focus on backend development.  
My journey started in 2013, building mods and resources for games I loved playing. 🎮  
Since then, I've been diving deep into coding, creating cool tools, and learning something new daily. 🌱  

When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me:  
🚗 Going for random drives  
🏋️‍♂️ Hitting the gym  
🛠️ Developing fun side projects  
🎲 Exploring mods for games  

If you're here to explore my work, feel free to check out some of my GitHub stats below:
